        <h2>The best grain-free cookies you'll ever have</h2>
          <p>If your're trying to watch what you eat but still crave a delicous cookie then this grain-free recipe is a must try.</p>
          
          <p>Coconut flour is a gluten-free flour made solely from coconuts. It's high in fiber and is a good source of protein.
             Adding it to your diet may promote stable blood sugar, good digestion, and heart health. 
             If you've never thought of cookies as a health food, maybe after this you will</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup coconut flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown coconut sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted & cooled</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350ÂºF and grease a cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine coconut flour, brown sugar, baking soda and salt.</li>
            <li>Add in eggs, butter, vanilla and chopped chocolate.  Combine until a thin dough forms.</li>
            <li>Wet hands and roll dough into 9 balls, if you just spoon the cookies onto the baking sheet without rolling them into balls, the cookies won't come out pretty and smooth.  Be sure to roll them into balls.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until the bottom of the cookies turn golden brown.</li>
          </ol>
