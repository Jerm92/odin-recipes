They bend without cracking making them great for tacos, burritos, wraps, quesadillas, and more.</p>
          
          <p>Plus, it only takes four ingredients to make these easy tortillas!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup Cassava flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup warm water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Whisk together Cassava flour and salt. Add the oil and warm water until a nice dough begins to form. The dough should not be dry or too wet and sticky.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough until smooth.</li>
            <li>Divide into six dough balls.</li>
            <li>Roll each dough ball between two pieces of parchment paper until thin or use a tortilla press.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Once properly heated, place tortilla on the skillet. Wait for the air bubbles to form (approx. 1 minute) and then flip. Remove before tortilla becomes stiff.</li>
            <li>Let cool on a wire rack until they go from hot to warm, then stack on a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Note: Do not overcook the tortillas or they will become stiff. Don’t worry if they do, you can always make tostadas or use them as a base for taco salad if the first few you make don’t bend enough.</p>
